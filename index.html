                    never written a line of code. I
                    needed some structure from
                    professionals who can help me
                    learn programming step by step. I
                    was encouraged to enroll by a
                    former student of theirs who can
                    only say wonderful things about
                    the program. The entire
                    curriculum and staff did not
                    disappoint. They were very hands-
                    on and I never had to wait long for
                    assistance. The agile team project,
                    in particular, was outstanding. It
                    took my learning to the next level
                    in a way that no tutorial could ever
                    have. In fact, I’ve often referred to
                    it during interviews as an example
                    of experience. It certainly helped
                    me land a job as a full-stack 100%
